list with lsblk, partition with fdisk
The following partitions are required for a chosen device:

* One partition for the root directory /.
* For booting in UEFI mode: an EFI system partition.
------

EFI
mnt/boot  ->  /dev/efi_partition
bootctl does not support installing systemd-boot to an MBR partitioned disk
if installing from windows etc, check for existing EFI:
fdisk -l /dev/sdx -> gpt if the partition table is GPT or dos if it is MBR
it is recommend to make the EFI partition at least 300 MiB

SWAP
[SWAP] ->  /dev/swap_partition
More than 512 MiB (with lots of memory (+32Gb) 2Gb swap is OK,
if using applications heavy on RAM, make saw same size as RAM)

ROOT
/mnt  ->  /dev/root_partition
remainder of device

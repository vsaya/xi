Device driver
lspci -v
02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Attansic Technology Corp. L1 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter (rev b0)
 	...
 	Kernel driver in use: atl1
 	Kernel modules: atl1

Next, check that the driver was loaded by running dmesg | grep module_name as root
dmesg | grep atl1
...
atl1 0000:02:00.0: eth0 link is up 1000 Mbps full duplex

Search the internet for the right module/driver for your chipset. Some common modules are 8139too for cards with a Realtek chipset, or sis900 for cards with a SiS chipset
Once you know which module to use, try to load it manually:
modprobe module_name
modprobe -r module_name (unload module)

systemctl enable NetworkManager.service

Once the NetworkManager daemon is started, it will automatically connect to any
available "system connections" that have already been configured
it prefers wired connections

Any "user connections" or unconfigured connections will need nmcli or an applet
to configure and connect.

NetworkManager comes with nmcli(1) and nmtui(1).

List nearby Wi-Fi networks:
nmcli device wifi list

Connect to a Wi-Fi network:
nmcli device wifi connect SSID_or_BSSID password password

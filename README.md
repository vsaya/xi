xsaya installation helper for arch linux (personal installation guide).

This guide uses an overview file called 'o' to keep a list of instructions for installing arch linux the xsaya way.
When a bullet point is a short description of the step, additional information can be found on the step in a file with the same name.
When a bullet point is in itself a command, input the command with any parameters or values adjusted to the context of the installation.
When there's a tack (-) in front of a step, it indicates that it's a branch. Pick the appropriate step and cat out more information under the file with the same name if neccessary.

to get started:

`git clone https://github.com/vsaya/xi.git`

and

`cat xi/o`

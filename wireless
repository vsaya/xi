Check the following lists to discover if your card is supported:
https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers
list of wireless cards and whether or not they are supported either in the Linux kernel or by a user-space driver:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported
If your wireless card is not listed above, it is likely supported only under Windows (some Broadcom, 3com, etc). For these, you can try to use #ndiswrapper.

Managing a wireless connection requires a basic set of tools.
Either use a network manager or use one of the following directly:
wireless_tools
iw
wpa_supplicant
iwd

Discover access points:
iw dev interface scan | less

Note: If it displays Interface does not support scanning, then you probably forgot to install the firmware. In some cases, this message is also displayed when not running iw as root.

connect:
iw dev interface connect "your_essid" key 0:your_key
iw dev interface connect "your_essid" (no encryption)
